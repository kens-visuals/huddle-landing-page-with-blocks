## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There's not much to say about this project, other than it was really fun to put together. I like such projects where you can take a full control of BEM methodology. For example, the blocks in the middle section are identical, the only difference is when on the desktop layout one of them is reversed. So by adding a modifier class, one can easily change it. Till the end of the year, 3 projects left to do. On to the next one!
